## Updating the code on early Bally/Stern Solid State Pinball Games

This project consists of a library & several game implementations which add modern features and deeper rule sets to early Solid State games. The software is hosted on a custom card that plugs into the MPU's J5 connector. The card allows the player to boot to either the original code or the new implementation with a switch mounted behind the coin door.

### How to get it
In order to update a machine, the operator will need to:
- [Build the hardware](hardware.md)
- [Get the library](library.md)
- [Get the software](software.md)
- [Compile the software and install it on an Arduino Nano](compile.md)
- [Install the the hardware on J5 of a working machine](install.md)
